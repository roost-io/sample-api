# ================================VULNERABILITIES================================
# Vulnerability: Exposure of Internal System Details
# Issue: The log entries expose internal details about the system's workings, specifically the methods of the ProductController class. This exposure can be observed in nearly all the log lines.
# Solution: Avoid logging internal class and method names. Set up proper logging configuration to avoid potential security risks.
# 
# Vulnerability: Unencrypted Sensitive Information
# Issue: Several log entries expose unencrypted product information, such as product IDs and their related info (product name, description, price). This is available in multiple lines, such as lines having 'Retrieved product:'.
# Solution: Sensitive data like product information should be encrypted while storing and/or logging. Use encryption methods while dealing with sensitive information to ensure data security.
# 
# Vulnerability: Repeated Failed Data Retrievals
# Issue: Several product ID retrievals fail repeatedly. For example, product IDs 4433221100 and 5566778899 have failed on multiple attempts.
# Solution: Monitor and set up alerts for such reoccurring failed attempts. This could be a sign of attempted malicious activity. Use rate-limiting to control such repeated requests.
# 
# Vulnerability: GDPR Compliance - Data Minimization Principle Violation
# Issue: Product details along with IDs are logged in the entries. This is a violation of GDPRâ€™s data minimization principle, as only the necessary data must be retained.
# Solution: Ensure to log only necessary data, and avoid logging data that is not required for identifying issues. Tighten the logging policy to adhere with GDPR principles.
