// 
// ================================VULNERABILITIES================================
// Vulnerability: Data Leakage
// Issue: The log entries contain product details (including pricing information) that are openly accessible. For example, products retrieved at lines: 3, 5, 7, 13, 15, 17, 19 and 22.
// Solution: Implement obfuscation or encryption for sensitive information in log files
// 
// Vulnerability: Missing Error Handling
// Issue: There are multiple instances of a 'Product not found' error suggesting that requests are being made for non-existent products. This may reveal an information disclosure vulnerability or could potentially be an attempt to probe the API. Lines: 2, 9, 11, 25, 27, 29, 31, 33, 35, 37, 39, 41, 43, 45, 47, 49 and many others illustrate this issue.
// Solution: Review the application's error-handling procedures. Ensure that the application handles errors gracefully and does not provide more information than necessary to the user.
// 
// Vulnerability: GDPR Compliance
// Issue: The logs contain product IDs which, depending on the business context, may be classified as Personal Identifiable Information (PII). This could potentially lead to a GDPR compliance issue.
// Solution: Anonymize or pseudonymize product IDs and any other potentially identifiable information in log files to ensure GDPR compliance
// 
// Vulnerability: Potential Scan or Attack
// Issue: If the same IP or user agent is making these failed requests at lines 25, 27, 29, 31, 33, 35, 37, 39, 41, 43, 45, 47, 49 and others, it could be a sign of a scan or attack.
// Solution: Consider implementing stricter rate limiting, request cooldowns for specific endpoints, IP blocking for suspicious behavior, or Captcha systems for verification.
