# ================================VULNERABILITIES================================
# Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)
# Issue: Excessive exposure of object IDs in API endpoints, visible in GET /api/products/{numerical_id} log lines. This potentially can lead to unauthorized data access if a valid ID is guessed by an attacker.
# Solution: Use globally unique IDs, UUIDs or obfuscate the direct references. Implement appropriate access controls to prevent unauthorized data access.
# 
# Vulnerability: Information Exposure Through an Error Message
# Issue: Detailed error messages in log entries related to product not found can provide unnecessary details to a potential attacker, seen in entries with - Product not found.
# Solution: Error messages sent to the clients should be generic and not reveal specific system details or results which could be used by an attacker.
# 
# Vulnerability: Insecure data handling and potential GDPR non-compliance
# Issue: Logs don't provide evidence of encryption or anonymization of sensitive product details. This can pose a risk specifically under GDPR, which requires data protection by design and by default.
# Solution: Implement encryption or tokenization of sensitive data. Remove any unnecessary sensitive data in log entries. Ensure proper access controls to logs.
# 
# Vulnerability: Security Misconfiguration
# Issue: The server exposes detailed endpoint API logs along with potential sensitive data. External exposure of these logs poses a significant risk.
# Solution: Apply stricter access controls and monitoring including limiting IP addresses which have access to these logs, apply authentication.
