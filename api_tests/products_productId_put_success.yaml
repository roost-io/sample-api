# ================================VULNERABILITIES================================
# Vulnerability: Exposure of sensitive information
# Issue: The provided logs disclose product-related details including product id, product description, and product price. This could be exploited maliciously. Refer to all lines.
# Solution: Logging strategy should be reviewed. Exclude from logging or mask sensitive data to avoid revealing any critical information in log details.
# 
# Vulnerability: Potential HTTP Verb Tampering
# Issue: The log entries show HTTP PUT method being used extensively. HTTP PUT method is intended to update resources and if not properly secured can be exploited. Refer to all lines.
# Solution: Ensure that the HTTP PUT method is secured with necessary authorization and authentication checks. Use a WAF to detect and mitigate HTTP verb tampering.
# 
# Vulnerability: Inconsistent Resource Identifier
# Issue: The logs indicate inconsistent usage of product resource identifier 'id'. Sometimes product id is being referred with its actual id (e.g., 1, 4), and sometimes with random values (e.g., 2323424, 644647). Improper resource identifiers might lead to unauthorized access from potential usurpers. Refer to lines: 'PUT /api/products/2323424' and 'PUT /api/products/644647'.
# Solution: Review and update the logic which is setting or updating the product resource identifier. Make sure it follows a logical and secure pattern.
