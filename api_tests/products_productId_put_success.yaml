// 
// ================================VULNERABILITIES================================
// Vulnerability: Exposed Product Information
// Issue: Product information including id, name, description, and price are being logged. This can pose a threat if an attacker gains access to the logs. Logs are found in all lines.
// Solution: Avoid logging sensitive pieces of information. Encrypt necessary data.
// 
// Vulnerability: Information Leakage through URLs
// Issue: Sensitive data such as product ID is being included in the URL (PUT requests). Placing sensitive information in the URL can lead to exposure through various ways like browser history, log files, or network monitoring. Logs are found in all lines.
// Solution: Instead of sending data like product ID through URL, use more secure methods like HTTP headers.
// 
// Vulnerability: Non-existent product updates
// Issue: Attempts to update non-existent products are being made. If these aren't genuine errors, it could be an indicator of a breach. Log lines with 'Product not found' messages are the culprit.
// Solution: Implement a mechanism to track and limit the number of such occurrences per user. If the limit is reached, take appropriate steps like temporarily blocking the user or adding extra authentication steps.
