# ================================VULNERABILITIES================================
# Vulnerability: Exposure of sensitive error information
# Issue: The logs in your system are exposing information about internal processes e.g. 'http-nio-8080-exec-9'. This could potentially give an attacker information they can use to exploit the system.
# Solution: Consider implementing a system of custom error messages. Limit the information given in log instances and ensure the logs are stored securely.
# 
# Vulnerability: API Product deletion
# Issue: Repetitive deletion requests for the same product could indicate a breach attempt. For instance, repeated deletion attempts were made on products: 22, 2323, 123456, etc.
# Solution: Consider monitoring repeated failed request triggers or rate limiting API requests.
# 
# Vulnerability: Lack of Encryption
# Issue: The logs are plaintext and could potentially expose sensitive data. While this specific log does not contain identifiable PII/PCI, future logs may, or could be paired with other logs that do.
# Solution: Ensure that all logs are encrypted during transmission and at rest, to protect them from unauthorized access.
# 
# Vulnerability: Lack of anomaly detection
# Issue: The logs indicate repetitive attempts to delete products that either do not exist or have already been deleted. This pattern signifies a potential security breach.
# Solution: Implement an anomaly detection system that alerts administrators when repeated, failed actions occur in order to detect and mitigate potential security breaches more effectively.
# 
# Vulnerability: GDPR Compliance
# Issue: While this log does not specifically contain PII/PCI data, the logging of such data could potentially lead to GDPR non-compliance.
# Solution: Ensure that PII/PCI data is never unencrypted in logs and is stored only as necessary. Regular audits of stored data should be conducted along with implementation of 'right to forget' processes.
