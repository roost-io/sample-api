# ================================VULNERABILITIES================================
# Vulnerability: Information Disclosure (CWE-200)
# Issue: Product deletion operations are fully logged, but those log entries are not sanitized. This behavior discloses whether a product exists or not, which could allow an attacker to map all existing products. This information is available in each DELETE request log entry.
# Solution: Adjust logging levels for DELETE operations to only log the action, not the result. Alternatively, sanitize the logs to ensure the existence of a product is not disclosed in log entries.
# 
# Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) (CWE-639)
# Issue: The product ID (which could be sensitive information depending on the product type) directly referred in the URI could be tampered by an attacker. This is evident in DELETED calls to /api/products/{product_id}.
# Solution: Implement indirect object references, such as using a per-session or per-user map from random tokens to actual product IDs to avoid revealing the actual IDs.
# 
# Vulnerability: Brute Force (CWE-307)
# Issue: Repeated 'Product not found' error messages indicate that an attacker might be trying to brute force the product space, as evident from the repeated DELETE requests on the same product ID after a 'Product not found' message.
# Solution: Implement an account lockout or delaying login prompts to guard against brute force attacking. Monitor and alert repeated failed attempts in a short time span.
# 
# Vulnerability: Insufficient Logging & Monitoring (CWE-778)
# Issue: The logs show detailed information about the actions taken, but do not indicate whether these actions were performed by authorized users or not.
# Solution: Include user information and IP addresses in logs, monitor logs regularly for suspicious behavior, and implement timely alerts for such activities.
