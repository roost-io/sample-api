# ================================VULNERABILITIES================================
# Vulnerability: GDPR Compliance due to Detailed Logging
# Issue: Detailed logging of the operations on products includes the timestamp of the operation and details about the operation, but it doesn't include any personal identifiable information. However, if logs were to have PII data, it might lead to a potential regulatory issue.
# Solution: Review the logging policy to ensure that only necessary information is logged. If data has to be logged, ensure that necessary security measures like data masking or pseudonymization techniques are implemented. Also ensure to have a strong access control for logs data, and regularly monitor them.
