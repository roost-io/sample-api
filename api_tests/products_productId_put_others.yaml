// ================================VULNERABILITIES================================
// Vulnerability: Sensitive Data Exposure
// Issue: The log entries include product update details with the product name, description and price information being exposed. While these data points do not necessarily contain sensitive, private or GDPR-related data, it's best practice to treat them as proprietary information. If the exposed data were to include Personally Identifiable Information (PII), Payment Card Information (PCI) or any other sensitive details, it would pose a significant security threat and potentially violate GDPR.
// Solution: Develop a logging policy that defines what type of data is acceptable to include in logs. Sensitive data should be avoided where possible and obfuscation, tokenization or encryption should be used when needed. For GDPR compliance, limit the data being logged, stored, and processed to only what is necessary.
// 
// Vulnerability: Information Disclosure
// Issue: The server is disclosing internal operational details, which may assist an attacker in exploiting a potential vulnerability. For example, the log messages include the HTTP method (PUT), the URI (/api/products/1), the class info (c.b.p.controller.ProductController), and method name (updateProduct).
// Solution: Configure your log settings to reduce the level of detail provided in log messages. While this information may be useful for debugging, it should not be outputted in production environments due to the risk of sensitive information exposure.
