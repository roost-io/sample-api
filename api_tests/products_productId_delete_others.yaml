// 
// ================================VULNERABILITIES================================
// Vulnerability: Potential Unauthorized Access Attempts
// Issue: Repeatedly attempts were made to delete already deleted or non-existent products, suggesting potential unauthorized activity.
// Solution: Consider implementing an account lockout or delay policy upon repetitive failed deletion attempts. Other defenses include logging and monitoring access attempts, hardening systems, limiting privileges and using intrusion detection and prevention systems.
