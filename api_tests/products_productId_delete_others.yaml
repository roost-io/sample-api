# Test generated by RoostGPT for test products-artillery using AI Type Azure Open AI and AI Model roost-gpt4-32k
# 
# ================================VULNERABILITIES================================
# Vulnerability: Inappropriate Handling of Exceptional Conditions
# Issue: The logs show multiple deletions of non-existent products on several occasions. This could indicate potential forceful browsing or improper input from the user, resulting in attempts to delete non-existent resources.
# Solution: Implement proper error handling and appropriate exception messages avoiding the exposure of system details. Enable input validation to ensure requested resource to delete exists before processing the request. Log and monitor these activities for unusual patterns which could indicate an attack attempt.
