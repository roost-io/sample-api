# ================================VULNERABILITIES================================
# Vulnerability: Poor Security Log Data
# Issue: The logs show successful and unsuccessful product deletions but do not indicate which user or system process requested each operation (entire log)
# Solution: Implement user or process tracking within your logging systems to better understand and monitor system activity. This includes logging user IDs, IP addresses, used device and session identifiers.
# 
# Vulnerability: Potential Brute Force Attack
# Issue: Multiple repeated DELETE requests to products that do not exist could signify repeated attempts to identify valid products for deletion (multiple lines including timestamp '09-10-2023').
# Solution: Implement rate limiting or automated block on IP addresses or accounts showing anomalous deletion request behavior. Alerts for such patterns can be set up to notify the security team in real time.
# 
# Vulnerability: Lack of Data Encryption/Protection Practices
# Issue: The application log shows plaintext API paths and product details which suggests a lack of proper encryption in the logging system, making the logs vulnerable in case of unauthorized access (entire log).
# Solution: Implement a secure logging policy that includes encryption of log entries, secure log transfer and storage, and restricted log access.
# 
# Vulnerability: GDPR Compliance Violation
# Issue: Logs containing product data may indirectly link to personally identifiable information (PII) or sensitive data which falls under GDPR protection (entire log).
# Solution: Ensure proper access control and encryption for log data. Perform regular audits to identify and remove any PII that is being logged inadvertently. Consider anonymization or pseudonymization of log data where possible.
