// ================================VULNERABILITIES================================
// Vulnerability: Sensitive data exposure
// Issue: Product details like Product ID, Product Name, Product Description, and Product Price are exposed in plain text. This could potentially be used by an attacker for various forms of attacks.
// Solution: Do not log sensitive information about your products in plain text. This information should be encrypted.
// 
// Vulnerability: Verbose Error Messages
// Issue: The log entries contain a detailed account of the operations conducted by the application. Malicious users could use this information to understand the system's structure and design a targeted attack.
// Solution: Implement a logging mechanism that only records the minimum level of details needed for diagnostics. Implement context-awareness in the logging mechanism where the logs under normal operation contain minimal information, while if an error or certain flagged event occurs it provides more verbose logging.
// 
// Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)
// Issue: The application seems to be retrieving products with direct references to database identifiers without proper authorization verification. This could allow an attack to input different IDs and access unauthorized information.
// Solution: Implement proper access control practices. Make sure that the application verifies the requester's permissions before performing any action on the server.
