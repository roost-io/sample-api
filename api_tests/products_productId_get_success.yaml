# ================================VULNERABILITIES================================
# Vulnerability: Exposure of Information Leading to Unauthorized Access
# Issue: The logs include explicit retrieval of product details in plain text, including product names and prices. This could potentially provide an avenue for competitors to gain unauthorized access to disaggregate pricing data, impacting competitive advantage. Refer to all lines from the logs.
# Solution: Adopt obfuscation techniques to mask certain sensitive information within your logs, such as product details. Consider implementing role-based log views, where some information is obfuscated or redacted based on the viewer's role.
# 
# Vulnerability: Insufficient Logging and Monitoring
# Issue: There is no evidence of failed access attempts in the logs. Not capturing failed attempts could create opportunities for a persistent attacker to try different ProductIds until finding one that exists. Without proper logging, their actions would be undetected. Refer to all lines from the logs.
# Solution: Improve logging to capture both successful and unsuccessful API calls. Regularly review logs to tackle any unauthorized or suspicious activities in real time. Implement automation to receive notifications when certain events occur.
# 
# Vulnerability: Inadequate Protection of Sensitive Data
# Issue: GDPR compliance could be called into question, as there is no sign of information being encrypted at rest or in transit. While the logs provided do not detail any PII or payment information being processed, it’s still crucial that all data be protected, considering GDPR’s broad scope. Refer to all lines from the logs.
# Solution: Implement security measures like encryption during data transmission and storage. Develop privacy by design in the application by creating measures where the system forgets data after performing its intended operation with the data.
