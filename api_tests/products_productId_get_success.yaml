# ================================VULNERABILITIES================================
# Vulnerability: Information Disclosure
# Issue: Product retrieval method and internal API route exposed in the logs (e.g., `c.b.p.controller.ProductController.getProductById - GET /api/products/4`)
# Solution: Sanitize or mask specific parts of the method call or route in the logs. Avoid disclosing unnecessary internal details.
# 
# Vulnerability: Sensitive Data Exposure
# Issue: Product details are displayed in the logs, including product ID and other specifics (e.g., `Retrieved product: {"id":1,"name":"Chips","description":"Uncle Chips","price":120.0}`)
# Solution: Sensitive and private data should not be logged unless absolutely necessary, and then the logs should be carefully protected. Apply log data masking or pseudonymization if such data has to be logged for a valid purpose, according to GDPR and PCI-DSS standards.
# 
# Vulnerability: Potential Denial of Service (DoS)
# Issue: Frequent requests for non-existing products can cause unnecessary load on the server database (e.g., `GET /api/products/4433221100 - Product not found`). When such requests are made duplicate times, they can be an indicator of probing or a potential DoS attack.
# Solution: Implement rate-limiting and block or limit consecutive unsuccessful requests. Monitoring and alerting should be put in place to detect potential DoS attacks.
# 
# Vulnerability: Insecure Logging Practices
# Issue: Logs expose which executors were used to perform a task. This could potentially expose sensitive application details.
# Solution: Logs should be sanitized and should not expose any sensitive application details such as which executor was used. If necessary, this information should be obfuscated, encrypted, or pseudonymized.
